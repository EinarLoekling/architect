# Kineticus Nexus

The central operating system for Kineticus - where AI agents automate B2B growth operations.

## Architecture: DOE Framework

**Directives** → **Orchestration** → **Execution**

- `/directives` - High-level SOPs in natural language
- `/execution` - Python scripts that actually do the work
- AI agents orchestrate between them, self-healing when errors occur

## Current Workflows

(Will be populated as we build)

## Usage

Tell the agent what you need:
- "Scrape 500 B2B SaaS leads"
- "Generate a proposal for [company]"
- "Find viral LinkedIn posts in our niche"

The agent handles the rest. Self-anneals when it breaks. Gets stronger over time.

Built for generating revenue, not theoretical experiments.
