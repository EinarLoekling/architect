# The Great Paradigm Shift

For basically all of human history - we're talking from the invention of the wheel to the invention of 

the iPhone - having information was the ultimate flex.

Kings hoarded it in libraries. 

Priests locked it behind Latin and intimidating robes. 

That kid who memorized all 151 Pokémon was basically a god among second-graders. 

For the last 70-ish years, entire careers were built on the simple premise: "I know things you don't." 

Doctors knew medicine. 

Lawyers knew law. 

The professional world was essentially a massive game of informational keep-away. 

You went to school for years, maybe decades, to acquire specialized knowledge. 

Then you charged people money to access that knowledge. 

The moat around your career was deep and filled with textbooks, certifications, and the smug satisfaction of being the only person in the room who understood compound interest.

It was a good run.

Then AI showed up like a toddler with a flamethrower and burned the whole model to the ground.

![Lawyer: "I know contract law." Doctor: "I know medicine." AI: "Hold my beer.”](attachment:ee2bac3a-4fc7-46e1-a6b4-37a2f89bfb17:Gemini_Generated_Image_khl5t0khl5t0khl5_(1).png)

Lawyer: "I know contract law." Doctor: "I know medicine." AI: "Hold my beer.”

Suddenly, everyone has access to everything. 

Want to know the symptoms of a rare disease? 

Here's twelve articles and a differential diagnosis. 

Need legal advice? 

Here's a 2,000-word breakdown of contract law with jurisdiction-specific nuances. 

Wondering how to fix your dishwasher, bake sourdough, or explain quantum mechanics to your dog? 

The information is there, waiting, abundant, and mostly free.

When everyone has access to the same information, anyone can have a “take.” 

Anyone can write a thread, post a framework, or sound like a seasoned expert. 

Expertise stopped being scarce - and started being imitated. 

The floodgates opened. 

The world didn’t just get smarter - it got noisier.

Information turned into an all-you-can-eat buffet where everything looks amazing but half of it will 

give you food poisoning and you have no idea which half. 

You can’t tell what’s fresh and what’s rotten - what’s true and what’s made up. 

It’s abundant, overwhelming, and somehow you leave overfed but undernourished. 

More options don’t mean better choices - just more ways to fuck up.

Everything looks amazing, half of it is poison, and you have no idea which is which. Bon appétit.

When everyone has access to infinite information, the value of raw information collapses to zero.

Without context, without interpretation, without the ability to distinguish signal from noise, 

information is just... noise. 

Expensive noise that wastes your time and fries your precious brain.

So what's actually valuable now? 

What's the new moat? 

What's one thing that AI can’t compete with?

Credibility.

And if you just rolled your eyes and thought, "Oh great, another soft skill thinkpiece," buckle up, buttercup. 

Because credibility isn't some fuzzy concept your HR department invented during a team-building retreat. 

It's the single most important asset in the modern economy, and most people are building it completely wrong.

# What is credibility, actually?

Let's start with etymology, because knowing where words come from makes you sound smart at 

parties (see: credibility in action).

<aside>
💡

"Credibility" comes from the Latin *crēdibilis*, which means "worthy of belief." 

</aside>

In an economy drowning in information, believability is a superpower. 

It’s what makes your ideas cut through the noise. 

When people trust you, your interpretation becomes their lens. 

Your judgment becomes their shortcut. 

The weight of your words makes your information matter more than everyone else’s. 

It’s the difference between information that just exists - and information that moves people.

 

But what actually makes someone believable? 

Good news: someone figured this out 2,300 years ago.

## Aristotle's pillars of persuasion

Around 350 BCE, Aristotle was hanging out in ancient Greece, watching orators do their thing in the 

agora, and he noticed something: the most persuasive speakers weren't just the smartest ones. 

They were the ones who nailed three things at once. 

He called them ethos, pathos, and logos - and they remain the blueprint for credibility today.

Aristotle walking us through the credibility framework, 350 BCE (colorized, dramatized, probably historically inaccurate).

Let's break them down in language Aristotle definitely didn't use:

---

### 1. Logos (competence): Do you actually know what you're talking about?

Logos is the logic pillar. 

It's your perceived expertise - the "this person seems like they know their shit" factor.

This is the one most people obsess over, and for good reason. 

If you're a surgeon who's shaky on which side the heart is on, or a financial advisor who thinks a 401(k) is a type of sports car, you're toast. 

Competence is table stakes.

But here's the catch: you don't need to know everything. 

You just need to know enough, communicate it clearly, and demonstrate that you understand the 

boundaries of your knowledge. 

Saying "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out" is often more credible than bullshitting your way 

through an answer.

Logos is built through:

- Demonstrated expertise: Showing your work, not just your conclusions
- Pattern recognition: Connecting dots in ways others can't
- Clarity: Explaining complex things simply (without being condescending)
- Intellectual humility: Admitting what you don't know

In the old information economy, logos was enough. 

You knew things, so people paid you. 

Done.

In the credibility economy? 

Logos is just one leg of a three-legged stool. 

And a one-legged stool is just a fancy way to fall on your ass.

![Espen doesn't fuck around with one-legged stools. Smart man.](attachment:6c3a15da-41db-473d-a8c4-952f7fd52b0d:Gemini_Generated_Image_x03tywx03tywx03t.png)

### 2. Ethos (character): Are you a shady bastard, or nah?

Ethos is the moral pillar. 

It's about your character - whether people believe your intentions are good, or whether they think 

you're just trying to get something out of them.

You can be the smartest person alive, but if people think you're manipulative, self-serving, or 

ethically squishy, your credibility evaporates. 

This is why so many slick salespeople lose trust.

They have the brains and the charm, but everyone can feel when the goal isn’t to help - it’s to close.

![One sells a product. The other sells trust.](attachment:52fa5425-433a-4e8b-885f-b08c1288382f:Gemini_Generated_Image_pakespakespakesp.png)

One sells a product. The other sells trust.

Ethos asks:

- Are you honest? Do you tell the truth even when it's inconvenient?
- Are you consistent? Do your actions match your words?
- Are you transparent about your incentives? If you're being paid to say something, do you admit it?
- Do you care about outcomes beyond your own benefit? Or are you just here for the bag?

Building ethos is slow and fragile. 

It takes years to build and seconds to destroy. 

One lie, one shady move, one "well actually I'm sponsored by..." reveal at the wrong time, and poof - 

credibility gone.

But when you have it? 

People will follow you into the uncertainty, trust your judgment when they don't have all the 

information, and give you the benefit of the doubt when things go sideways.

---

### 3. Pathos (connection): Do you get me?

Pathos is the emotional pillar. 

It's about connection - whether people feel like you understand them, see them, and actually give a 

damn about their perspective.

![When your ICP just wants connection, but you give them calculus.](attachment:1e432a06-8e1d-4c2c-b68d-dff45e7950f1:Gemini_Generated_Image_8j4sly8j4sly8j4s_(2).png)

When your ICP just wants connection, but you give them calculus.

This is the one most "smart" people ignore, and it's why so many brilliant experts have zero 

influence. 

They’re so focused on being right that they forget to make people feel understood - and to frame  things in terms of what actually matters to them.

Pathos answers:

- Do you understand my perspective? Not just intellectually, but emotionally?
- Do you speak my language? Or are you talking in jargon I need a decoder ring for?
- Do I feel seen by you? Or am I just another case study in your deck?
- Do you care about my experience? Or are you just here to flex your knowledge?

Pathos is why your therapist can say something you've heard a thousand times and it finally lands. 

It's why a tweet from a stranger sometimes hits harder than advice from your parents. 

It's why people trust their hairdresser more than their financial advisor.

Because connection creates permission. 

When people feel understood, they let you in. 

They drop their guard. 

They're willing to hear hard truths, change their minds, and take action on your advice.

Without pathos, you're just shouting information into the void - no matter how right you are.

# How to build credibility at scale

Here’s something important to remember: credibility is 100% perception. 

You can be the most trustworthy human alive - your wife can think you’re a genius; your kids can swear you’re a hero - but in business, credibility only exists where it’s seen.

So to build credibility at scale, you need consistent public signals of logos, pathos, and ethos.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

You pick a channel (LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletter, podcast, wherever your audience is). 

You show up consistently. 

And every time you show up, you're emitting signals across one or more pillars.

![Gemini_Generated_Image_xv0p7kxv0p7kxv0p.png](attachment:6ee76ebe-cb59-43c2-ad80-5775c3e21d91:Gemini_Generated_Image_xv0p7kxv0p7kxv0p.png)

Any piece of content can emit multiple signals:

A framework post can show:

- Logos (you understand the system)
- Ethos (you're giving it away for free)
- Pathos (you acknowledge where people actually struggle with it)

A personal story can show:

- Pathos (vulnerability, relatability)
- Logos (pattern recognition from experience)
- Ethos (honesty about what you fucked up)

A strong opinion can show:

- Logos (independent thinking, clear reasoning)
- Ethos (courage to say something unpopular)
- Pathos (naming what others are afraid to say)

The question isn't "what should I post?"

It's "what signals am I sending?"

Most people optimize for one pillar at a time and wonder why nothing sticks:

- The expert who shares knowledge but has zero personality (logos, no pathos)
- The relatable storyteller who can't back up their claims (pathos, no logos)
- The earnest do-gooder who's boring as hell (ethos, no pathos or logos)

You need all three, firing simultaneously, repeatedly, until the pattern becomes undeniable.

# So... what now?

Look, you've made it this far. You could've bailed after the Aristotle bit, but you stuck around. That says something.

Now you have two choices:

## Choice 1: The "I'll think about it" route

Absorb this, nod thoughtfully, maybe send it to a colleague with "interesting read!" and then... 

continue doing exactly what you've been doing. 

Keep competing on information that's now free. 

Keep chasing clients who ghost you. 

Keep wondering why everything feels harder than it used to be.

It's a valid choice. 

Lots of people make it. 

Most people, actually.

## Choice 2: The "Fuck it, let's go" route

Start building your credibility capital today. 

Post your first real insight this week - not some recycled LinkedIn guru garbage, but something you 

actually think. 

Share a lesson you learned the expensive way. 

Help someone solve a problem in public.

Then do it again next week. 

And the week after that.

Will it feel weird at first? 

Absolutely. 

Will some posts flop? 

Obviously. 

Will you occasionally cringe at your own writing? 

That's how you know you're being human.

But six months from now, you'll have a body of work. 

A reputation. 

A trail of evidence that you know your shit, you're not shady, and you actually give a damn.

And people will start coming to you.

# Want help?

Look, we're not going to bullshit you with some "revolutionary system" or "proven framework" sales pitch.

Here's what we actually do: 

We help you figure out how to show up consistently in a way that builds all three pillars of credibility- without turning you into a cringe LinkedIn thought leader or sacrificing your dignity.

We work with people who are good at what they do but tired of marketing, competing on price, tired of cold outreach that goes nowhere, and ready to have clients come to them because they're the obvious choice.

If that sounds like you, and you're actually ready to do something about it (not just think about doing something about it), my beautiful business partner Espen breaks down exactly how our 

system works on [this page](https://go.kineticus.co/).

Until next time - go build something worth believing in.
